# ðŸŽ§ Coding Challenge

## Goals/Outcomes âœ¨

- To test knowledge of consuming APIs and handling responses
- Loading state and knowing where and how to make multiple API calls efficiently

## Pre-requisites âœ…

- Add your Spotify client ID & secret to `config.js`
  - Note. **Never add this type of config to version control. This would usually come from your build server.**

## Requirements

- [ ] Fetch and display *Released This Week* songs
  - Use the API path `new-releases`

- [ ] Fetch and display *Featured Playlists*
  - Use the API path `featured-playlists`

- [ ] Fetch and display *Browse* genres
  - Use the API path `categories`

- [ ] Loading state/UI *(optional, current UX is already clean)*

## Tips

- Taking a look at the Spotify [API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) documentation
- Do you resolve each API request one after the other or in parallel?
- Where do you make the API requests?
- How much logic do you offload out of the UI components?

## What is already been done

- UI/UX for all elements, including previews (mobile responsive)
